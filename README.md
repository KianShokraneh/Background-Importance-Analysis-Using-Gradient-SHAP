# Background-Importance-Analysis-Using-Gradient-SHAP
Analyze the impact of background regions on image classification using Gradient SHAP. This project visualizes how a ResNet18 model, fine-tuned on CIFAR-10, leverages different parts of an image for decision-making, providing insights into model interpretability.
