# Background-Importance-Analysis-Using-Gradient-SHAP
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates background importance analysis using the Gradient SHAP method. The script leverages a pre-trained ResNet18 model fine-tuned on the CIFAR-10 dataset to perform interpretability analysis on image classifications.

## Overview

The project focuses on analyzing the importance of background regions in images when making classification decisions. By applying Gradient SHAP, the script highlights which parts of an image most influence the model's predictions, helping to understand the model's behavior better.

## Key Features

- **Model Loading**: Utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet18 model for CIFAR-10 image classification.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes transformations necessary to prepare CIFAR-10 images for model input.
- **Gradient SHAP Implementation**: Implements Gradient SHAP to compute the attribution values, indicating the contribution of different image regions to the model's prediction.
- **Background Object Analysis**: The analysis uses sample images generated with GPT-3's DALL-E, where objects were deliberately added to the background to test if the model would misclassify based on these background elements.
- **Visualization**: Provides a clear visualization of the attributions overlaid on the original images, highlighting areas of the image that are most influential in the model's decision-making process.
